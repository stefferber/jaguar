Jaguar I-Pace - Collecting data from electric vehicle only during charging
in python based on the excellent python library https://github.com/ardevd/jlrpy

There are two scripts in order to run them on two different computers:

	* jaguar-charging.py: logging files to drive every 2 Min during charging process
	* jaguar-charging-viz.py: reading all log files into a time series data base and plotting graphs
